I am a graduating computer science and mathematics major with a special
interest in big data. With these skills, I hope to enter research in the
machine learning field. As a back end programmer, I enjoy low level coding to
include my mathematics knowledge in squeezing out greater performance.
However, I am not afraid to step up to high level languages for quick scripting
and glue code.

I have extensive experience with search.
Through my internship with CCEL, I built, from ground zero, the search engine
backing [PreachingandWorship.org](https://preachingandworship.org/). Also, I
implemented significant performance improvements for the search component of
[Hymnary.org](https://hymnary.org/).

When I run into bugs or missing features in libraries I use, I generally try my
own hand at resolving them and submitting the patches to the open source
community. As time allows, I also do primary development for several open
source projects. I am a member of [Code::Blocks](http://codeblocks.org/) and
[Webgrind](https://github.com/jokkedk/webgrind).

My hobbies include nature photography and piano.
