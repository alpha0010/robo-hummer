### Design 

We designed a pipeline to bring audio from a web interface through our machine learning,
and into the k-nearest neighbors search.

We collected audio samples to train the neural network.

In testing this, we discovered it to be unreliable,
so we created a keyboard interface to make sure the searching works properly.
