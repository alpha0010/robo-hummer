### Future Work

The neural net could be trained more to recognize humming.

We could experiment with LSTM - Long Short-Term Memory neural networks.

The new search with the
keyboard interface could possibly be used as a replacement for the old Hymnary
melodic search feature.
More improvements to the interface - such as editing the sample,
may be wanted.
Ability to import music from MIDI files is a critical feature for this to be used
as a replacement for the former melody search.
