### Vision and Overview

This senior design project aimed to write a program that searches for songs on
Hymnary.org by a user's audio rendition of the melody (especially via humming).
This project hoped to be an alternative to the existing melody search.

We planned to solve this by designing a system to recognize tunes based
on individual rhythms and notes.  In order to do so, we attempted to train a
Neural Net to analyze audio signals for these rhythms/notes. 
We came up with a search algorithm to match the analyzed audio to actual song
definitions. This software was cleaned up so that it is a somewhat usable product.
