## Conclusions

Neither the YIN algorithm nor the neural network based approaches worked well
for vocal input,
so, we removed the humming-based search page in favor of the keyboard interface
for getting notes.
Searches come back with great results.
Since the search index data came from Hymnary.org, each search will return a link
to the relevant hymn instance on Hymnary.org.
