### Results

Our initial neural networks for predicting notes from audio data supported
excessive learning capabilities. This resulted in the networks learning the
exact training files. When fed new data, prediction performance was abysmal,
often ranging +/- 1 octave.

To improve the model, we reduced the size of the neural network while
increasing the number of 


Through much neural network training, we couldn't get the humming part of the project
working soon enough.

We concluded our work, since time had run out.
