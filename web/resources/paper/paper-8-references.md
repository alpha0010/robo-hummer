For our project, we used Marsyas and Tensorflow for the audio analysis section.

For the search backend, we used NMSLib, the Non-Metric Space Library, as well as a few
scripts to parse musicXML into a simpler format for searching.

The web framework used for the site was laravel.

For the keyboard frontend, we used MIDI.js for audio feedback and VexFlow for visual
musical notation feedback.
